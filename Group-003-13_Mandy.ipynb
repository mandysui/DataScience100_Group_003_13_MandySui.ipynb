    "### Data Wrangling Plan\n",
    "1) **Data Import and Cleaning**  \n",
    "   Import both `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`. Inspect the datasets for inconsistencies or missing values, especially in the `gender` and `played_hours` columns. Clean the data by removing or handling missing or duplicated entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Data Type Transformation**  \n",
    "   Ensure that variables are correctly formatted:  \n",
    "   - `gender`: encoded as a factor (categorical variable).  \n",
    "   - `played_hours`: numeric variable representing total hours played.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Handle Missing Values**  \n",
    "   Address any missing or inconsistent data.  \n",
    "   - For categorical variables (like `gender`), use placeholders such as “Unknown” or exclude missing records if necessary.  \n",
    "   - For numerical variables (like `played_hours`), check for zero or unrealistic values and handle appropriately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Standardizing**  \n",
    "   Standardize the dataset by applying scaling to the numeric variable `played_hours`. This step is important because KNN uses distance-based calculations, and unscaled data could cause bias in predictions."
